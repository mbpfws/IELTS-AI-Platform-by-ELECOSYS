In addition to the [base models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini), the Gemini API offers experimental models available in Preview, as defined in the [Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms), meaning it is not for production use. We release experimental models to gather feedback, get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly, and highlight the pace of innovation happening at Google. What we learn from experimental launches informs how we release models more widely. An experimental model can be swapped for another without prior notice. We don't guarantee that an experimental model will become a stable model in the future.

## Use an experimental model

**Important:** Support for an experimental model can change at any time.

The Gemini API's experimental models are available for all users. You can use the experimental models either in your code directly using the Gemini API, or you can use an experimental model in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/):

## Available models

| Model code | Base model | Highlights | Release date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gemini-exp-1121` | Gemini | Improved coding, reasoning, and vision capabilities | November 21, 2024 |
| `gemini-exp-1114` | Gemini | Quality improvements | November 14, 2024 |

**Note:** Support for individual experimental models is not permanent or long-term, and can be turned off without prior warning. Experimental models cannot be used in production code.
