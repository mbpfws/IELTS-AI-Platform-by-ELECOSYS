Gemini can respond to prompts about audio. For example, Gemini can:

- Describe, summarize, or answer questions about audio content.
- Provide a transcription of the audio.
- Provide answers or a transcription about a specific segment of the audio.

**Note:** You can't generate audio *output* with the Gemini API.

This guide demonstrates different ways to interact with audio files and audio content using the Gemini API.

## Supported audio formats

Gemini supports the following audio format MIME types:

- WAV - `audio/wav`
- MP3 - `audio/mp3`
- AIFF - `audio/aiff`
- AAC - `audio/aac`
- OGG Vorbis - `audio/ogg`
- FLAC - `audio/flac`

### Technical details about audio

Gemini imposes the following rules on audio:

- Gemini represents each second of audio as 25 tokens; for example, one minute of audio is represented as 1,500 tokens.
- Gemini can only infer responses to English-language speech.
- Gemini can "understand" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens.
- The maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours. Gemini doesn't limit the *number* of audio files in a single prompt; however, the total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed 9.5 hours.
- Gemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution.
- If the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels down to a single channel.

## Before you begin: Set up your project and API key

Before calling the Gemini API, you need to set up your project and configure your API key.

## Make an audio file available to Gemini

You can make an audio file available to Gemini in either of the following ways:

- [Upload](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio?lang=node#upload-audio) the audio file *prior* to making the prompt request.
- Provide the audio file as [inline data](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio?lang=node#inline-data) to the prompt request.

## Upload an audio file and generate content

You can use the File API to upload an audio file of any size. Always use the File API when the total request size (including the files, text prompt, system instructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB.

**Note:** The File API lets you store up to 20 GB of files per project, with a per-file maximum size of 2 GB. Files are stored for 48 hours. They can be accessed in that period with your API key, but cannot be downloaded from the API. The File API is available at no cost in all regions where the Gemini API is available.

Call [`media.upload`](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1beta/media/upload) to upload a file using the File API. The following code uploads an audio file and then uses the file in a call to [`models.generateContent`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#method:-models.generatecontent).

```
// Make sure to include these imports:
// import { GoogleAIFileManager, FileState } from "@google/generative-ai/server";
// import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";
const fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(process.env.API_KEY);

const uploadResult = await fileManager.uploadFile(
  `${mediaPath}/samplesmall.mp3`,
  {
    mimeType: "audio/mp3",
    displayName: "Audio sample",
  },
);

let file = await fileManager.getFile(uploadResult.file.name);
while (file.state === FileState.PROCESSING) {
  process.stdout.write(".");
  // Sleep for 10 seconds
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10_000));
  // Fetch the file from the API again
  file = await fileManager.getFile(uploadResult.file.name);
}

if (file.state === FileState.FAILED) {
  throw new Error("Audio processing failed.");
}

// View the response.
console.log(
  `Uploaded file ${uploadResult.file.displayName} as: ${uploadResult.file.uri}`,
);

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.API_KEY);
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-flash" });
const result = await model.generateContent([
  "Tell me about this audio clip.",
  {
    fileData: {
      fileUri: uploadResult.file.uri,
      mimeType: uploadResult.file.mimeType,
    },
  },
]);
console.log(result.response.text());files.js
```

## Get metadata for a file

You can verify the API successfully stored the uploaded file and get its metadata by calling [`files.get`](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1beta/files/get).

```
// Make sure to include these imports:
// import { GoogleAIFileManager } from "@google/generative-ai/server";
const fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(process.env.API_KEY);

const uploadResponse = await fileManager.uploadFile(
  `${mediaPath}/jetpack.jpg`,
  {
    mimeType: "image/jpeg",
    displayName: "Jetpack drawing",
  },
);

// Get the previously uploaded file's metadata.
const getResponse = await fileManager.getFile(uploadResponse.file.name);

// View the response.
console.log(
  `Retrieved file ${getResponse.displayName} as ${getResponse.uri}`,
);files.js
```

## List uploaded files

You can upload multiple audio files (and other kinds of files). The following code generates a list of all the files uploaded:

```
// Make sure to include these imports:
// import { GoogleAIFileManager } from "@google/generative-ai/server";
const fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(process.env.API_KEY);

const listFilesResponse = await fileManager.listFiles();

// View the response.
for (const file of listFilesResponse.files) {
  console.log(`name: ${file.name} | display name: ${file.displayName}`);
}files.js
```

## Delete uploaded files

Files are automatically deleted after 48 hours. Optionally, you can manually delete an uploaded file. For example:

```
// Make sure to include these imports:
// import { GoogleAIFileManager } from "@google/generative-ai/server";
const fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(process.env.API_KEY);

const uploadResult = await fileManager.uploadFile(
  `${mediaPath}/jetpack.jpg`,
  {
    mimeType: "image/jpeg",
    displayName: "Jetpack drawing",
  },
);

// Delete the file.
await fileManager.deleteFile(uploadResult.file.name);

console.log(`Deleted ${uploadResult.file.displayName}`);files.js
```

## Provide the audio file as inline data in the request

Instead of uploading an audio file, you can pass audio data in the same call that contains the prompt.

Then, pass that downloaded small audio file along with the prompt to Gemini:

```
const base64Buffer = fs.readFileSync(join(__dirname, "./samplesmall.mp3"));
const base64AudioFile = base64Buffer.toString("base64");

// Initialize a Gemini model appropriate for your use case.
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({
  model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
});

// Generate content using a prompt and the metadata of the uploaded file.
const result = await model.generateContent([
    {
      inlineData: {
        mimeType: "audio/mp3",
        data: base64AudioFile
      }
    },
    { text: "Please summarize the audio." },
  ]);

// Print the response.
console.log(result.response.text())

```

Note the following about providing audio as inline data:

- The maximum request size is 20 MB, which includes text prompts, system instructions, and files provided inline. If your file's size will make the *total request size* exceed 20 MB, then [use the File API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio?lang=node#upload-audio) to upload files for use in requests.
- If you're using an audio sample multiple times, it is more efficient to [use the File API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/audio?lang=node#upload-audio).

## More ways to work with audio

This section provides a few additional ways to get more from audio.

### Get a transcript of the audio file

To get a transcript, just ask for it in the prompt. For example:

```
// To generate content, use this import path for GoogleGenerativeAI.
// Note that this is a different import path than what you use for the File API.
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";

// Initialize GoogleGenerativeAI with your API_KEY.
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.API_KEY);

// Initialize a Gemini model appropriate for your use case.
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({
  model: "gemini-1.5-flash",
});

// Generate content using a prompt and the metadata of the uploaded file.
const result = await model.generateContent([
    {
      fileData: {
        mimeType: audioFile.file.mimeType,
        fileUri: audioFile.file.uri
      }
    },
    { text: "Generate a transcript of the speech." },
  ]);

// Print the response.
console.log(result.response.text())

```

### Refer to timestamps in the audio file

A prompt can specify timestamps of the form `MM:SS` to refer to particular sections in an audio file. For example, the following prompt requests a transcript that:

- Starts at 2 minutes 30 seconds from the beginning of the file.
- Ends at 3 minutes 29 seconds from the beginning of the file.

```
// Create a prompt containing timestamps.
const prompt = "Provide a transcript of the speech from 02:30 to 03:29."

```

### Count tokens

Call the [`countTokens`](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1/models/countTokens) method to get a count of the number of tokens in the audio file. For example:

```
const countTokensResult = await model.countTokens({
   generateContentRequest: {
     contents: [
       {
         role: "user",
         parts: [
           {
             fileData: {
               mimeType: audioFile.file.mimeType,
               fileUri: audioFile.file.uri,
             },
           },
         ],
       },
     ],
   },
 });

```
